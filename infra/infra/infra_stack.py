"""SJSU Student Success Navigator infrastructure stack.

Each "Copy over and morph" bullet in docs/build-plan.md lands its gav section into the
banner below that names it, in this order (mirroring gav's own section order so a pull is
a copy + rename, not a re-architecture):

  1. Vector store + Knowledge Base + S3 data source   ("pull gav kb section")      DONE
  2. Scraper Lambda + deps layer + daily schedule
     + on-deploy install trigger                      ("pull gav scraper shell")
  3. Bedrock Guardrail (PROMPT_ATTACK input screen)   (docs/synthesis.md decision)
  4. Chat Lambda + role + deps layer                  ("pull gav lambda section")
  5. Cognito pool + client + JWT authorizer
     + HTTP API + routes + throttling                 ("pull gav api gateway")
  6. Site bucket + CloudFront (OAC) + Astro deploy
     + config.json stamping                           ("pull gav frontend s3 + cloudfront")

All changeable knobs come from the repo-root config.yaml (see infra/config.py), which
also validates the file at synth - the L1 Cfn* constructs used below do not check any
property constraints themselves.
