"""Load the repo-root config.yaml for the CDK app.

config.yaml is the single source of truth for changeable knobs. This module resolves it
relative to __file__ so it works no matter what the current working directory is.

Layout: this file is <repo>/infra/infra/config.py, so the repo root is parents[2] and
config.yaml sits directly under it.

The synth-time validators (CORS wildcard rejection, scraper URL-list checks) land in
the next commit - build-plan: "pull gav config skeleton and synth validators". This
scaffold carries only the loader so the stack and tests have a config home now.
